THIS IS THE CHANGELOG OF THE "censReg" PACKAGE

Please note that only the most significant changes are reported here.
A full ChangeLog is available in the log messages of the SVN repository
on R-Forge.


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5-14 (2012-06-28)

* the calculation of the gradients of the log-likelihood function for 
cross-sectional data is numerically more stable


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5-12 (2012-06-01)

* added nobs() method that returns the (total) number of observations 


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5-10 (2012-04-12)

* added margEff() method that computes the marginal effects of the explanatory 
variables on the expected value of the dependent variable evaluated at the mean 
values of the explanatory variables. This functionality is currently not 
available for panel data models.


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5-8  (2012-03-04)

* censReg() has an argument "logLikOnly" now: if this argument is set to TRUE, 
the model is not estimated but the log-likelihood contributions of all 
observations/individuals and the corresponding gradients calculated at the 
parameters specified by argument "start" are returned

* made the calculation of the log-likelihood value of random effects panel data 
models with censored dependent variables and the calculation of the corresponsing 
gradient(s) numerically more robust and stable by calculating and storing the 
*logarithms* rather than the actual numbers


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5-6  (2011-09-06)

* fixed bug that made it impossible to specify starting values
for the estimation of censored random-effects panel data models
(many thanks to Igors Lahanciks for reporting this bug!)


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5-4  (2011-05-17)

* fixed bug that occured when a factor had "empty" levels
(many thanks to Ulrich Morawetz for reporting this bug!)

* censReg() now additionally returns the model terms and 
the degrees of freedom of the residuals

* added a model.frame() method for objects of class "censReg"

* added a formula() method for objects of class "censReg"

* added extractAIC() method for objects of class "censReg"

* added estfun() method for objects of class "censReg" 
that has an argument "includeSigma" (defaults to TRUE), 
which determines whether the derivative with respect to the 
logarithm of the variance parameter should be included


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5-2  (2010-08-25)

* initial public release of the censReg package
