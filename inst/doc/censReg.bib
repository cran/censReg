  abstract = {Advances in computing power allow the empirical researcher to use
  intensive computional techniques to solve and estimate nonlinear panel-data
  models, specifically those arising from nonlinear panel data such as Probit
  and Tobit models. In these cases, maximum-likelihood estimation can be
  cumbersome if not analytically intractable, requiring a T-variate multiple
  integration whose numerical approximation can sometimes be very poor.
  Different solutions are offered based variously on integral approximation
  through simulation, some form of Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), or
  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. This paper compares the outcomes of
  those methods available in standard econometric packages, providing
  illustrations among prepackaged algorithms and a MCMC Gibbs sampler for
  nonlinear panel data. Using Chib (1992) and Chib and Carlin (1999), I derive
  a sampler for Probit/Tobit panel data and provide easy-to-use software for
  implementing the Gibbs sampler in panel data with discrete/limited dependent
  variable. I show that, when dealing with a large dataset, MCMC methods may
  replace the procedures provided in standard econometric packages.}

  title = {Fixed and Random Effects in Nonlinear Models},

  University},
  abstract = {This paper surveys recently developed approaches to analyzing
  panel data with nonlinear models. We summarize a number of results on
  estimation of fixed and random effects models in nonlinear modeling
  frameworks such as discrete choice, count data, duration, censored data,
  sample selection, stochastic frontier and, generally, models that are
  nonlinear both in parameters and variables. We show that notwithstanding
  their methodological shortcomings, fixed effects are much more practical than
  heretofore reflected in the literature. For random effects models, we develop
  an extension of a random parameters model that has been used extensively, but
  only in the discrete choice literature. This model subsumes the random
  effects model, but is far more flexible and general, and overcomes some of
  the familiar shortcomings of the simple additive random effects model as
  usually formulated. Once again, the range of applications is extended beyond
  the familiar discrete choice setting. Finally, we draw together several
  strands of applications of a model that has taken a semiparametric approach
  to individual heterogeneity in panel data, the latent class model. A fairly
  straightforward extension is suggested that should make this more widely
  useable by practitioners. Many of the underlying results already appear in
  the literature, but, once again, the range of applications is smaller than it
  could be.}

  title = {Fixed Effects and Bias Due to the Incidental Parameters Problem in
  the Tobit Model},
  journal = {Econometric Reviews},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {23},
  number = {2},
  pages = {125-147},
  abstract = {The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) in nonlinear panel data
  models with fixed effects is widely understood (with a few exceptions) to be
  biased and inconsistent when T, the length of the panel, is small and fixed.
  However, there is surprisingly little theoretical or empirical evidence on
  the behavior of the estimator on which to base this conclusion. The received
  studies have focused almost exclusively on coefficient estimation in two
  binary choice models, the probit and logit models. In this note, we use Monte
  Carlo methods to examine the behavior of the MLE of the fixed effects tobit
  model. We find that the estimator's behavior is quite unlike that of the
  estimators of the binary choice models. Among our findings are that the
  location coefficients in the tobit model, unlike those in the probit and
  logit models, are unaffected by the ÔøOincidental parameters problem.ÔøO But,
  a surprising result related to the disturbance variance emerges instead - the
  finite sample bias appears here rather than in the slopes. This has
  implications for estimation of marginal effects and asymptotic standard
  errors, which are also examined in this paper. The effects are also examined
  for the probit and truncated regression models, extending the range of
  received results in the first of these beyond the widely cited biases in the
  coefficient estimators.}
